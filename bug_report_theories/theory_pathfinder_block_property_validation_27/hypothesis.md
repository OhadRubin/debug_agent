# Theory 27: Pathfinder Block Property Validation

## Hypothesis
The `isWalkable()` method in `MineflayerWorldProvider` depends on pathfinder block properties (`.safe` and `.physical`) that may be undefined or incorrectly calculated, causing valid walkable positions to be incorrectly rejected.

**The bug occurs because**:
- `isWalkable()` checks `blockAt.safe && blockAbove.safe && blockBelow.physical`
- If any of these properties are undefined, the boolean expression evaluates to `false`
- This causes actually walkable positions to be rejected during frontier component assignment
- Frontiers get dropped due to failed component lookups
- Eventually no valid frontiers remain, causing infinite "No valid targets found" loop

## Evidence from Code
In `minecraft_env.js` lines 72-74:
```javascript
const isSafe = blockAt.safe &&           // Current position is safe to occupy
             blockAbove.safe &&          // Headroom is safe
             blockBelow.physical         // Ground below is solid/physical
```

The code already has debugging infrastructure for this (Theory 15 debug wrapper) suggesting this has been a suspected issue before.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Mineflayer-pathfinder block properties might not be fully initialized for all blocks
- The movement system may return blocks with undefined properties under certain conditions
- The boolean logic fails silently when properties are undefined instead of properly handling edge cases
- This creates a mismatch where `getCellState()` considers a position walkable but `isWalkable()` rejects it

## Detection Method
Add logging to check if block properties (`.safe`, `.physical`) are undefined during `isWalkable()` calls, especially for positions that `getCellState()` marked as walkable.

## Expected Outcome
If this theory is correct, we should see:
1. `blockAt.safe`, `blockAbove.safe`, or `blockBelow.physical` returning undefined for some positions
2. These undefined properties causing `isWalkable()` to return false for actually walkable areas
3. Correlation between undefined properties and dropped frontier points
4. The pathfinder movement system not properly initializing block properties in certain scenarios

## Priority
**HIGH** - This is likely a contributing factor to Theory 26, potentially explaining why the pathfinder-based walkability check fails.
