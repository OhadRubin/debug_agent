# Theory 20: State Synchronization Deadlock

## Hypothesis
The undefined walkability values cause a state synchronization deadlock where the bot gets permanently stuck in a SCANNING → THINKING → SCANNING loop because the exploration system can never find valid targets, but also never properly terminates or handles the "no targets found" condition.

## Root Cause Analysis
The exploration state machine expects boolean walkability values to make progress through its states:
1. **SCANNING**: Discovers walkable cells
2. **THINKING**: Finds frontiers and selects targets
3. **MOVING**: Executes movement to targets

When walkability returns `undefined`, the system gets stuck because:
- SCANNING finds cells but can't properly classify them as walkable
- THINKING can't find valid components/frontiers due to classification failures
- The system defaults back to SCANNING instead of properly handling the failure condition

## Detection Method
- Track state transitions and loop cycles
- Monitor how long the bot spends in each state
- Count consecutive SCANNING → THINKING cycles without progress
- Verify that the bot never reaches MOVING state
- Track target selection failures and their causes

## Expected Evidence
- Repeated SCANNING → THINKING → SCANNING cycles
- Zero successful state transitions to MOVING
- Target selection consistently returning `null`
- No progress in exploration coverage
- Bot position remaining static despite active exploration

## Impact Assessment
This creates a user-visible deadlock where:
1. Bot appears to be "working" (scanning and thinking)
2. No actual exploration progress is made
3. Bot never moves from starting position
4. System runs indefinitely without achieving exploration goals
5. User sees repeated "thinking about where to go next" messages

From bug report evidence:
- Lines 107-134: Shows repeated SCANNING → THINKING loop
- Line 103: "Selected target: null" (consistent target selection failure)
- No MOVING state transitions visible in the logs

## Fix Strategy
Multiple approaches:
1. **Fix root cause** (Theory 16): Resolve undefined walkability values
2. **Add deadlock detection**: Track consecutive failed cycles and implement recovery
3. **Improve error handling**: Properly handle "no valid targets" condition
4. **Add fallback behavior**: When stuck, try expanding scan range or different exploration strategies
5. **State machine hardening**: Add timeouts and recovery mechanisms

## Related Evidence
From bug report:
- Bot remains at position `{"x":-31,"y":128,"z":362}` throughout entire log
- Repeated `FRONTIER_DEBUG: Selected target: null`
- No evidence of successful movement or position changes
- Continuous loop between SCANNING and THINKING states
