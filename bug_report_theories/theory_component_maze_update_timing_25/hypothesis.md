# Theory 25: Component Maze Update Timing

## Hypothesis  
The component maze update process completes the graph update but doesn't finish writing maze entries before frontier pathfinding attempts to access them, causing lookup failures.

## Evidence from Bug Report
- `THEORY_6_DEBUG: MAZE SUMMARY - 10 maze updates, 1750 entries written, 0 empty regions`
- Component analysis found 25 components but frontier lookup still fails
- Error occurs during pathfinding phase, not component detection phase

## Predicted Root Cause
The updateComponents() process has multiple phases:
1. Find components in regions
2. Create component nodes  
3. Update component maze entries
4. Detect component edges

Frontier pathfinding runs after phase 2 but before phase 3 completes.

## Detection Method
Add logging to track:
1. When each phase of component update starts/completes
2. When frontier pathfinding attempts component lookup
3. Whether maze entries exist at lookup time
4. Component maze state before/after update phases

## Expected Confirmation
If this theory is correct, we should see frontier pathfinding accessing component maze while updateComponentMaze() is still executing or hasn't been called yet for the target position.
