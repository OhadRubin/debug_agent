### Theory 7: Walkable Cell Detection vs Component Assignment Mismatch

**Hypothesis**: There's a fundamental mismatch between how cells are classified as WALKABLE during scanning and how components are detected, causing WALKABLE cells to exist but not be assigned to any components.

**Supporting Evidence from Bug Report**:
- 1,067 cells classified as WALKABLE during scanning
- State mismatches: "getCellState=WALKABLE but isWalkable=false" 
- All frontier detection succeeds (95 frontier points found) but component assignment fails
- Components are detected but lookup table entries are missing

**Suspected Root Cause**:
The `MineflayerWorldProvider.getCellState()` method and `MineflayerWorldProvider.isWalkable()` method use different logic to determine walkability, causing inconsistencies. The component detection relies on `isWalkable()` while terrain knowledge uses `getCellState()`.

**Detection Method**:
Add debug logging to track:
1. Direct comparison of `getCellState()` vs `isWalkable()` results for the same coordinates
2. Whether `findComponentsInRegion` finds any components when walkable cells exist
3. Whether the walkability check in `floodFill3D` is rejecting cells that were marked WALKABLE
4. The specific logic differences between the two walkability methods

**Specific Locations to Instrument**:
- `MineflayerWorldProvider.getCellState()` and `isWalkable()` for direct comparison
- `findComponentsInRegion` to track how many components are found vs expected
- `floodFill3D` walkability check to see if it rejects WALKABLE cells

**Expected Evidence if Theory is Correct**:
- Systematic differences between `getCellState()` and `isWalkable()` results
- `findComponentsInRegion` finding 0 components despite WALKABLE cells existing
- Inconsistencies in block classification logic between the two methods
