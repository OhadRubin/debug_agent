# Theory 18: Component Detection Cascade Failure

## Hypothesis
The undefined return values from `isWalkable()` cause component detection to fail completely, leading to empty component graphs and preventing frontier detection from finding any valid exploration targets.

## Root Cause Analysis
The component detection system in `BotComponentManager.findComponentsInRegion()` calls `worldDataProvider.isWalkable()` to identify walkable cells for flood-fill. When this returns `undefined` instead of `true`, the flood-fill algorithm skips those cells, resulting in no components being detected even in areas with valid walkable space.

## Detection Method
- Track calls to `isWalkable()` during component detection
- Count how many return `undefined` vs proper boolean values
- Monitor component creation success/failure rates
- Verify that regions with walkable cells fail to create components due to undefined returns

## Expected Evidence
- 100% of `isWalkable()` calls returning `undefined` during component detection
- Zero components created despite having walkable cells in scanned regions
- Component maze remaining empty after update operations
- Flood-fill algorithm terminating early due to undefined walkability checks

## Impact Assessment
This breaks the entire exploration pipeline:
1. No components detected → empty component graph
2. Empty component graph → frontier detection fails
3. No frontiers → no exploration targets
4. No targets → bot stuck in SCANNING → THINKING loop

The bug report shows:
- Line 53: "All 10 regions failed to create components despite walkable cells!"
- Line 55: "40960 interface violations caused component detection failures!"

## Fix Strategy
Either fix the root cause (Theory 16) or add defensive checks in component detection:
```javascript
// In flood-fill algorithm
if (worldDataProvider.isWalkable(worldX, worldY, worldZ) === true) {
    // Only proceed if explicitly true, not undefined or false
}
```
