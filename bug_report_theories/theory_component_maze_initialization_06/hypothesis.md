### Theory 6: Component Maze Initialization Failure

**Hypothesis**: The `componentColoredMaze` (component lookup table) is not being properly initialized or populated during the initial component detection phase, leaving it empty and causing all `getCompId3D` lookups to fail.

**Supporting Evidence from Bug Report**:
- 100% failure rate on `getCompId3D` calls (0 successes, 95+ failures)
- Error pattern "No X entry at (-35,131,378)" suggests the lookup table is completely empty
- 35,937 cells scanned with 1,067 classified as WALKABLE, but no components detected

**Suspected Root Cause**: 
The initial component detection in `BotKnowledgeManager` constructor or the `updateComponents` method is failing to populate the `componentColoredMaze` with the detected components, leaving the lookup table empty.

**Detection Method**: 
Add debug logging to track:
1. Whether `updateComponents` is being called successfully
2. Whether `updateComponentMaze` actually writes entries to the lookup table
3. The size/content of `componentColoredMaze` after component updates
4. Whether the initial component creation in constructor succeeds

**Specific Locations to Instrument**:
- `BotKnowledgeManager` constructor after `updateComponents` call
- `updateComponentMaze` method to verify entries are being written
- `getCompId3D` to log the state of the lookup table on first failure

**Expected Evidence if Theory is Correct**:
- `componentColoredMaze` will be empty (`{}`) or sparse after component updates
- `updateComponentMaze` will either not be called or fail to write entries
- Initial component detection may be finding 0 components despite walkable cells existing
