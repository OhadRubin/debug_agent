### Theory 10: Deep Copy Reference Corruption

**Hypothesis**: The `createDeepCopyOf3DArray` function used in `updateComponents` is creating corrupted or incomplete copies of the component lookup table, causing the original or copied table to lose references to component data.

**Supporting Evidence from Bug Report**:
- Component system seems to work initially but fails completely during lookups
- The `updateComponents` method creates a deep copy of `componentLookupTable`
- JavaScript object copying can fail with complex nested structures
- Sparse 3D array copying might not preserve all nested object references

**Suspected Root Cause**:
The `createDeepCopyOf3DArray` function is not properly deep-copying the nested 3D structure, causing shared references, missing nested objects, or incomplete copying that leaves the component lookup table corrupted.

**Detection Method**:
Add debug logging to track:
1. Integrity of the lookup table before and after `createDeepCopyOf3DArray`
2. Whether the deep copy preserves all nested structure levels
3. Reference comparison between original and copied tables
4. Whether component entries exist in original vs copied tables

**Specific Locations to Instrument**:
- `createDeepCopyOf3DArray` to verify deep copy integrity
- `updateComponents` to compare original vs copied lookup table contents
- Component lookup table structure validation after copy operations
- Direct verification that copied table contains expected component entries

**Expected Evidence if Theory is Correct**:
- Differences between original and copied lookup table contents
- Missing nested objects or levels in the copied structure
- Corrupted or undefined values in the copied lookup table
- The copy operation failing to preserve component ID assignments
