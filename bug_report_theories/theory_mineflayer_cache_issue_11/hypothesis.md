# Theory 11: Mineflayer Block State Caching Issue

## Hypothesis
The MineflayerWorldProvider's walkability cache (`this.walkabilityCache`) is storing incorrect boolean values or interfering with real-time block state detection, causing the `isWalkable()` method to return `undefined` instead of `true`.

## Supporting Evidence from Bug Report
- Bug report shows: "THEORY_7_DEBUG: CONFIRMED - isWalkable() returns undefined (not boolean true) for walkable cells"
- 100% mismatch rate between expected boolean true and actual undefined values
- Example shows air blocks with solid bedrock below should be walkable but return undefined

## Key Observations
1. `isWalkable()` method caches results in `this.walkabilityCache` using Map.set/get
2. If cache lookup fails or returns undefined, the method should compute fresh result
3. The caching logic might be corrupting boolean return values
4. Cache might not be properly cleared between scans despite `clearCache()` being called

## Detection Strategy
Add detailed logging to track:
1. Cache hit/miss ratios for walkable positions
2. Actual values stored and retrieved from cache
3. Cases where cache returns undefined vs computed fresh result
4. Cache state before/after clearCache() calls

## Test Cases
1. Track cache behavior for known walkable positions (air + solid ground)
2. Verify cache values match computed fresh values
3. Test if clearCache() properly empties the cache
4. Check if cache corruption occurs during rapid successive calls

## Expected Fix
If confirmed, fix could involve:
- Ensuring cache always stores explicit boolean values
- Adding validation that cached values are proper booleans
- Fixing cache key generation if it's causing collisions
- Improving cache clearing logic if it's not working properly
