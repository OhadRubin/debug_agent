# Theory 15: World Provider Interface Mismatch

## Hypothesis
The MineflayerWorldProvider doesn't implement the exact same interface contract as the simulation environment's PrivilegedWorldProvider, causing silent failures in component detection logic that expects specific return types or behaviors.

## Supporting Evidence from Bug Report
- Component detection works in simulation but fails completely in Minecraft environment
- MineflayerWorldProvider.isWalkable() returns undefined instead of boolean true
- Component flood fill might be failing silently due to interface differences
- Different world bounds handling between simulation and live environment

## Key Observations
1. PrivilegedWorldProvider.isWalkable() always returns boolean
2. MineflayerWorldProvider.isWalkable() can return undefined from cache
3. Component detection relies on strict boolean logic for flood fill
4. getBounds() method handled differently between providers
5. Caching behavior differs between simulation and live environments

## Detection Strategy
Add detailed logging to track:
1. Interface contract validation for all MineflayerWorldProvider methods
2. Return type checking (boolean vs undefined vs other)
3. Comparison of method behaviors between simulation and live environments
4. Component flood fill behavior with different provider implementations

## Test Cases
1. Replace MineflayerWorldProvider with PrivilegedWorldProvider temporarily
2. Add type assertions to verify all return values are proper booleans
3. Test component detection with simulated vs live world providers
4. Validate that all interface methods behave identically

## Expected Fix
If confirmed, fix could involve:
- Ensuring MineflayerWorldProvider returns exact same types as PrivilegedWorldProvider
- Adding interface validation/type checking
- Standardizing caching behavior between providers
- Creating abstract base class to enforce interface contract
