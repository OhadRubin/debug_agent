# Theory 13: Sensor Reading State Mapping Issue

## Hypothesis
The translation from mineflayer block states to the exploration system's C.WALKABLE/C.PASSABLE/C.WALL constants is incorrect or inconsistent, causing walkable cells to be misclassified during sensor reading processing.

## Supporting Evidence from Bug Report
- Bug report shows 1067 walkable cells found during scan
- But component detection creates 0 components despite walkable cells existing
- MineflayerWorldProvider.getCellState() might be returning wrong constants
- Block classification shows air: 23991, bedrock: 11251 - should create walkable areas

## Key Observations
1. MineflayerWorldProvider.getCellState() determines C.WALKABLE vs C.PASSABLE vs C.WALL
2. Logic checks: air block + solid ground below = C.WALKABLE
3. Air block + no solid ground = C.PASSABLE
4. Solid block = C.WALL
5. Component detection only processes cells marked as C.WALKABLE

## Detection Strategy
Add detailed logging to track:
1. Block state analysis for sample coordinates (air + bedrock below)
2. hasSolidGroundBelow() results for walkable positions
3. Final getCellState() return values vs expected values
4. Comparison between mineflayer block properties and exploration constants

## Test Cases
1. Test getCellState() for known good walkable positions (air above bedrock)
2. Verify hasSolidGroundBelow() correctly identifies solid ground
3. Check if block.solid, block.safe, block.physical properties are correct
4. Compare sensor reading states with component detection input states

## Expected Fix
If confirmed, fix could involve:
- Correcting the solid ground detection logic
- Fixing the air vs solid block classification
- Ensuring C.WALKABLE is returned for valid walkable positions
- Adjusting the pathfinder movements integration for ground detection
