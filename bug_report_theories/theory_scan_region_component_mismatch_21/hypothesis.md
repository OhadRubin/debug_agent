# Theory 21: Scan Region vs Component Update Mismatch

## Hypothesis
The sensor scanning process updates terrain knowledge for regions that the component analysis system doesn't properly process, leading to frontiers being detected in regions that lack component assignments.

## Evidence from Bug Report
- `THEORY_12_DEBUG: CONFIRMED - 17 scanned regions missing component updates`
- Position (-36,128,378) has terrain state 0 (WALKABLE) but maze value undefined
- Component update processes only 10 regions while scan touches 27 regions

## Predicted Root Cause
The scan() method in minecraft_env.js covers a larger area (27 regions) than what gets processed by component analysis (10 regions), creating gaps where terrain knowledge exists but component assignments don't.

## Detection Method
Add logging to compare:
1. Which regions the scan touches 
2. Which regions component analysis actually processes
3. Whether failed frontier positions fall in the gap regions

## Expected Confirmation
If this theory is correct, we should see frontier position (-36,128,378) falls in one of the 17 regions that were scanned but not updated with components.
